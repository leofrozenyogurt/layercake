Do you ever need certain items to be just on your apps mobile side. If so here is a great rails solution
which is light and simple.
<br>
<br>
Inside <code>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</code> do

{% highlight ruby %}
private
def mobile_device?
	request.user_agent =~ /Mobile|webOS/
end

helper_method :mobile_device?
{% endhighlight %}

<br>

then inside your view 
{% highlight ruby %}
if mobile_device?
	# do what you want here
end
{% endhighlight %}

<br> 

And thats it. A super light and simple approach that lets your site be more mobile.
