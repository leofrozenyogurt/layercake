Wrong. Especially in web development it's better to have something that 
is working flawlessly then to push a bad iteration and then have to come 
back and rewrite the code.

As a developer on a project you might think " oh well it will still work "
 but you have to put yourself in your clients shoes. If it does not match their 
 vision it could possibly affect their business and to any client that is a horrible 
 consequence and outcome due to the fact that they hired you to make their business better.
